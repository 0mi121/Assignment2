What is the value of clothes[0] and why?
const clothes = ['jacket', 't-shirt'];
clothes.length = 0;
console.log(clothes[0]);

Ans:-clothes[0] is undefined.
Explanation:-
Reducing the value of the length property has the side-effect of deleting own array elements whose array index is between the old and new length values.
Because of this length behavior, when JavaScript executes clothes.length = 0, all the items of the array clothes are deleted.
clothes[0] is undefined, because clothes array was emptied.
